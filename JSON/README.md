Tablib is a format-agnostic tabular dataset library, written in Python.

Output formats supported:

- Excel (Sets + Books)
- JSON (Sets + Books)
- YAML (Sets + Books)
- Pandas DataFrames (Sets)
- HTML (Sets)
- Jira (Sets)
- LaTeX (Sets)
- TSV (Sets)
- ODS (Sets)
- CSV (Sets)
- DBF (Sets)

Note that tablib *purposefully* excludes XML support. It always will. (Note: This is a
joke. Pull requests are welcome.)

Tablib documentation is graciously hosted on https://tablib.readthedocs.io

It is also available in the ``docs`` directory of the source distribution.

Make sure to check out [Tablib on PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tablib/)!
